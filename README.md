## Houses the Code for the Problem.
### The Results from the Producer & Consumer Problem.
![Results from the Producer & Consumer Problem](https://github.com/SeaPat22/Operating_Systems_Labs/blob/main/Producer%26Consumer%20Results.PNG)

This program was made using a Linux environment (Ubuntu).

After the program displays the messages that the Producer and the Consumer have both
been cleaned up, the user will need to enter Ctrl+C or ENTER to stop the program.

My code utilizes shared memory and semaphores to solve the Consumer & Producer Problem.
